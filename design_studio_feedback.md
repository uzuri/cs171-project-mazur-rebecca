Feedback from Matthew Silva
---------------------------

>I took a look at your project and it is very impressive. I found it very
interesting that you are doing a work-related project and it is actually
solving a real problem.


>The design is very good and is visually appealing. It looks a professional
website.

>If I had to suggest some improvements, I would say the search box wasn't
completely intuitive. I wasn't sure what it was doing at first. While the items
on the graph where highlighted, maybe more could be done to make them stand out.

>Another issue is that with all the information shown, the text can be a little
small to read. Due to this I don't think the visualization would scale well to
a much larger dataset. It would get too crowded.

>Another possible improvement might be to allow more freedom to rotate the graph.
The click to rotate is a little limited since rotation might make some of the
text easier to read.

>I agree with Matthew, it looks really good and I could definitely see it in use, speaking as a SEAS student who isn't sure where anything goes! I also agree on the points he's raised, especially regarding the search - maybe make the terms a different color instead of just bolded, since that tends to get lost if you have a lot of items displaying. Also a minor detail, but I'd suggest that the read more links open a new window rather than staying in the old one.

>I'm also wondering if you could show connections between things in the same categories, mostly in the related research interests, if your user isn't familiar with all of the possibilities, ex. the various interests linked to environmental studies or even just which interests commonly overlap. 

>Last nitpicky suggestion about colors, but is there a reason that the connections when you're hovering over an item show up red-orange? It's the only color encoding that doesn't seem intuitive to me, especially since when you have clicked on an item, the connections do turn to the appropriate colors. I think having the colors taken from the item linked to would help to distinguish your connections at a glance and improve readability.
