===========================

Please note that the "snapshot" method of keeping my files is not due to me not knowing how to use git, it's an artifact of wanting to be able to send some non-technical folks something to look at while working on something else :)  It's a quick and dirty way to make sure I know which hunk of code people are looking at without them having to understand anything but how to read a date.  It also makes for a very easy way to look back at code in action on the actual website.  I plan to neaten up the files quite a bit for final submission.

If you want to see the snapshots in action, visit http://theredsetter.com/cs171/; username visviewer, password acadvis.
